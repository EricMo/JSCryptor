*Javascript implementation of RNCryptor*

This implementation try to be compatible with Rob Napier's Objective-C implementation of RNCryptor, but currently it only supports decrypt of cbc mode through version 3.
This code is based in the [PHP implementation of RNCryptor](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-php). Any pull request is welcomed.
